    <h2> Formal Usability Study </h2>
    <p> This page describes one formal usability study that our team will perform.  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="starter-template text-section">
      <h3>Determining the Value of the Notes Section on the 'Add Dish' page</h3>
      <p>Our team wants to test the usefulness of the notes section on the add dish page of our app. We are unsure whether our users value the presence of the notes section and whether or not they find it helpful. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="starter-template text-section">
      <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>The presence of the notes section will not enhance the user’s experience with the app. Regardless of whether or not there is a separate notes section, the users won't add notes to the notes section, or if they do, the notes they do add are not valuable to the user in the short or long term. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="starter-template text-section">
      <h3>Experimental Conditions</h3>
      <p>The users are given the task of adding a meal to the app that they are accustomed to cooking. This meal should be familiar enough to the user that the user can recall the recipe from memory.</p>
      <p>We would ask the user to add a different meal to each of three designs of the app: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The recipe text box is above the notes text box</li>
        <li>The notes text box is above the recipe text box</li>
        <li>There is only a recipe text box provided (there is no notes text box)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The adding picture and the cancel/submission buttons on the add dish page will remain the same. Additionally, the appearance of the text entry boxes for the notes and recipe will remain the same. The only thing changing is the order and existence of the recipe and notes sections. </p>

    <div class="starter-template text-section">
      <h3>Dependent Variable</h3>
      <p>The orientation and presence of the recipe and notes inputs on the add dish page. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="starter-template text-section">
      <h3>Pattern to expect</h3>
      <p>Either users will not type notes in the notes section or they will not type notes in the notes section that they would find meaningful in the near or distant future. Additionally, when they are not provided with a notes section, they won’t miss that functionality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="starter-template text-section">
      <h3>Number of subjects</h3>
      <p>Ideally we would test at least ten subjects, each running two test iterations. For clarification, one iteration includes testing each of the three versions of the app described in the ‘Experimental Conditions’ section. We would want to run two test iterations because certain recipes may have meaningful notes to the user, where others may not. To gauge the consistency of the user’s behavior of the entry of notes for recipes, we would want to have two iterations of this test. </p>
