## This Repo

The website is based on the Flatly bootswatch theme using Twitter Bootstrap.

## Project

We want to create a way for people to easily see what they have in their kitchen, regardless of where they are. In this way, they can plan meals, grab a snack, or know what to add to their grocery list. We plan on having two distinct applications: one for the kitchen and one as a mobile app for people accessing information about the kitchen. 

This project will be focused on designing an interface for people who handle the groceries for the household. In particular, this interface will assist in cataloging the available ingredients/edibles in stock in the kitchen and produce grocery lists based on preset desired items and/or recipes. 

We are currently proposing the following features:
* a catalog of items sorted by category of food
* a receipt reader as a method of storing food
* a check in/out feature 
* a mobile window to the main app that shows the foods available
* to be decided...
